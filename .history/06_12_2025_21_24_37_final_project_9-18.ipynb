    "# Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to investigate whether a player's experience level and played hours could predict whether or not a player subscribes to a game-related newsletter, we used exploratory visual comparisons and a knn classification model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we had loaded our dataset from our Github repository (originally from the Minecraft Research Server), we were able to wrangle it to remove columns irrelevant to our purposes, like hashedEmail, name, Age, and gender. We then re-distinguished our experience variable with numerical values to make it easier for us to use the knn model later on in our analysis, but kept the original experience column as well for readability. In the end, we went from 7 variables to 4 variables. We also replaced the subscribe variable's values from TRUE and FALSE to subscribed and not subscribed, to again increase human readability. Lastly, we then converted the categorial variables subscribe, experience, and gender from data type \\<chr> to \\<fct> using the as_factor function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to build a more clear understanding of our dataset and the relationships within it, we calculated the mean age of the players (approx. 21 years old), mean played hours (5.9 hours) and created two key visualizations (both of them bar charts).\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these summary statistics and preliminary explorations, we decided to implement a knn classification model with subscribe as our response variable and the experience level and played_hours variables as predictors. We set up a random seed to ensure reproducibility and then split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets. Using this training set we created a workflow where we preprocessed all of our categorical variables into dummy variables and used the generalized linear model (glm) to train our model. Once we had our workflow, we used the tidy() method to see our coefficient estimates in order to see how each of our predictor variables contributed to subscription likelihood. After which, we used our testing data to evaluate the efficiency of our model and to generate test predictions. We found our model metrics (accuracy and kap) and also constructed a confusion matrix to evaluate whether our model is able to correctly predict/classify our different variables. These evaluation steps, especially accuracy and the confusion matrix, were essential to assessing model performance and determining where we could improve.\n"

    "  newsletter, indicating that in-game engagement strongly relates to\n",
    "  external engagement.\n",
    "- Players with **lower experience levels** (such Amateur and Beginner) show\n",
    "  higher subscription rates than Veterans and Pros.\n",
    "- The k-nearest neighbors model achieves **poor predictive performance** of about 42% accuracy,\n",

    "## Expectations vs. Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The results we uncovered through our data analysis align relatively closely with what we expected to find. It makes sense that individuals with higher than average commitment to the game, whether it be through experience or hours played, would show an increased interest in a newsletter subscription that likely details new updates, events, promotions, etc. related to the game. The weaker effects of the players' age and gender on subscription was slightly surprising, but understandable as playtime and experience level can vary widely between players of all ages and gender types.

    "## Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "The impact of our findings could flow down various routes. Firstly, our analysis informs newsletter writers to better understand their demographic of readers. They can use this data to decide what events to promote, what style/trends to adhere to for higher engagement, what topics to focus on based on the preferences of these specific types of players, and so on. Secondly, our results are also able to assist in the promotion of the newsletter itself. Long-time players with greater experience and a higher number of logged played hours (ie. players with a higher predicted likelihood of being a subscriber) could have more promotional content and notifications pushed on them, rather than those with a lesser predicted likelihood of being a subscriber. This will impact the success of the newsletters, while at the same time forcing newsletter writers to think about how to appeal to these less experienced and/or less playtime individuals in order for their newsletter to reach a wider audience of players. Lastly, the analysis that shows our model demonstrates a moderate predictive performance, suggesting that other unobserved factors may play an additional role in newsletter subscription may be useful in informing the researchers to look into other possible contributing factors beyond what they already have.

    "## Future Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Expanding on the last point made in the \"Impacts\" section of this report, our moderate predictive performance ability stimulates the question of what other factors could act as a possible contributor to subscription status other than experience and played hours, and more so than age and gender. It also generates the question of what can be changed about the newsletter so that it appeals to players with less played hours and/or experience as well? It may be of interest to investigate whether this lack of subscriptions from individuals with less played hours and/or experience is solely due to the fact that they may just be inherently less interested in the game itself, or if it's because they feel specifically that the newsletter doesn't appeal to their more beginner level interests, whether it be due to a sense of exclusivity, lack of knowledge regarding certain game terminology, or lack of events and information that benefits them. All of these questions would be meaningful to look into further in order to benefit player engagement, inclusivity, and the overall success of the newsletter in spreading information. "
