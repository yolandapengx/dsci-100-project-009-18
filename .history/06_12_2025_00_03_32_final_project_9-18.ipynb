    "# Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to investigate whether a player's experience level, gender, age, and played hours could predict whether a player subscribes to a game-related newsletter, we used visual comparisons and logistic regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we had loaded our dataset from our Github repository (originally from the Minecraft Research Server), we were able to wrangle it to remove columns irrelevant to our purposes, like hashedEmail and name. Moreover, we were able to filter for rows that had missing age values as that would hinder our analysis and analytic tools, and also ended up converting the type of Age from numeric to integer. In the end, we had gone from 196 observations to 194 observations and 7 variables  to 4 variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to build a more clear understanding of our dataset and the relationships within it, we calculated the mean age of the players (approx. 21 years old), mean played hours (5.9 hours) and created two key visualizations (a bar chart and a box plot). The bar chart (figure 1) shows the relationship between subscription rates and experience levels. It can be seen that groups with higher experience levels (veteran, pro) had greater subscription rates, which hints at a relationship between experience levels and subscription rates. The box plot (figure 2) was used to compare between subscribers and non-subscribers and their played hours. We were able to conclude that subscribers tended to have higher median played hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these summary statistics and preliminary explorations, we decided to implement a logistic regression model with subscribe (true/false) as our response variable and the experience level, played_hours, gender, and age variables as predictors. We set up a random seed to ensure reproducibility and then split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets. Using this training set we created a workflow where we preprocessed all of our categorical variables into dummy variables and used the generalized linear model (glm) to train our model. Once we had our workflow, we used the tidy() method to see our coefficient estimates in order to see how each of our predictor variables contributed to subscription likelihood. After which, we used our testing data to evaluate the efficiency of our model and to generate test predictions. We found our model metrics (accuracy and kap) and also constructed a confusion matrix to evaluate whether our model is able to correctly predict/classify our different variables. These evaluation steps, especially accuracy and the confusion matrix, were essential to assessing model performance and determining where we could improve.\n"

    "## Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "The impact of our findings could flow down various routes. Firstly, our analysis informs newsletter writers to better understand their demographic of readers. They can use this data to decide what events to promote, what style/trends to adhere to for higher engagement, what topics to focus on based on the preferences of these specific types of players, and so on. Secondly, our results are also able to assist in the promotion of the newsletter itself. Long-time players with greater experience and a higher number of logged played hours (ie. players with a higher predicted likelihood of being a subscriber) could have more promotional content and notifications pushed on them, rather than those with a lesser predicted likelihood of being a subscriber. This will impact the success of the newsletters, while at the same time forcing newsletter writers to think about how to appeal to these less experienced and/or less playtime individuals in order for their newsletter to reach a wider audience of players. Lastly, the analysis that shows our model demonstrates a moderate predictive performance, suggesting that other unobserved factors may play an additional role in newsletter subscription may be useful in informing the researchers to look into other possible contributing factors beyond what they already have.
